  <h1>Region traffic dispersion measurement results.</h1>

  <h2>Overview</h2>

  <p>This is a measurement of the traffic dispersion of a region with a rate limiter.</p>

  <h2>Description of the data used for the measurement</h2>

  <p>
    Three regions were used for the measurement.
    The characteristics of each region are as follows
  </p>

  <table border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>region</th>
        <th>quota</th>
        <th>duration</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>us-west1</td>
        <td>100 times</td>
        <td>60 sec.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>us-west2</td>
        <td>100 times</td>
        <td>60 sec.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>us-west3</td>
        <td>50 times</td>
        <td>60 sec.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <ul>
    <li>quota: Requests per duration(s) limit.</li>
    <li>duration: Request limit duration(seconds).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>To verify that traffic is properly distributed among the three regions, traffic is sent with the following contents.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>In all, the traffic is sent 1,875 times.</li>
    <li>Traffic is generated approximately 10.4 times per second.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Measurement results</h2>

  <p>Below is a graph of the measurement results, where the Y-axis is the number of traffic performed and the X-axis is the time the traffic was requested.</p>

  <p>
    The graph shows that traffic is appropriately distributed by region.
    <br>
    Since <code>us-west1</code> and <code>us-west2</code> have the same <code>quota</code> and <code>duration</code>, we can see that the traffic is approximated.
    <br>
    The <code>us-west3</code> has half the <code>quota</code> compared to the other two regions, so the traffic is similarly halved.
    <br>
    <br>
    That is all for the report.
    <br>
